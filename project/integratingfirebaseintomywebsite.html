                            <p>I decided to learn Google's awesome platform Firebase out of interest for a position. Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja">The Net Ninja's</a> tutorial series on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jUPIes_B8vRjn1_GaplOPQ">Firebase: Auth</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i_aLkr62adUTJi53y7OjOf">Firebase: Cloud Functions</a> I was able to easily pick up and add Firebase as a backend platform for my currently static website hosted by Gitpages.</p>

                            <h3 class="section-header">The Goals</h3>
                            <p>My main goal for this project was to learn Firebase in a practical setting. Seeing as my website already has a blogpost format, I decided to create a metadata system that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Has a user system for authentication purposes</li>
                                <li>Creates new blogpost metadata</li>
                                <li>Deletes blogpost metadata</li>
                                <li>Edits/Updates blogpost metadata</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Notes: This system will only manage metadata, not the actual content in each blogpost. Firestore is only a database, not a file system, thus storing entire html files of info is not what it is meant for. In future projects I will most likely migrate this website to a different host (like AWS) to allow support for such features.</p>

                            <p>Before adding functionality to edit projet metadata, I want to have a user system in place to use for authentication.</p>
                            <p>Thankfully, Firebase Auth is super easy to setup and use, so it was ready in no time. </p>
                            <img class="blog-img" src="/project/integratingfirebaseintomywebsite/firebaseauth.png">
                            <p>
    I censored my personal email, but I manually added an account for myself to use.</p>
                            <p>
    Next I created a login page, nothing special as this is just for myself to use.</p>
                            <img class="blog-img" src="/project/integratingfirebaseintomywebsite/loginpage.png">
                            <p>
    It is almost empty with nothing but a submit form. I will most likely go back and update this page's look and feel but for now I am mostly focused on functionality.</p>
                            <p>
        The code that runs the page is expectedly short. Firebase's web SDK simplifies the login process to a single function</p>
                            <pre><code>const loginForm = document.querySelector(&quot;#loginForm&quot;);
loginForm.addEventListener('submit', (e) =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault(); 
    const email = loginForm['email'].value;
    const password = loginForm['password'].value; 
    auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email,password).then((cred)=&gt;{
        console.log(cred);
    });
});
auth.onAuthStateChanged((user)=&gt;{
    if(user){
        window.location.href=&quot;/editprojects.html&quot;
    }
});</code></pre>
                            <p>
    Logging in with the auth object is handled completely by the Firebase SDK. Once the user is logged in an auth state change event is triggered. When this event fires, if the user is logged in, it redirects them to the edit projects page. The editing page is the only page which the user would need to be logged in to use.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="cloudfunctions">

                            <p>Now I will create the backend for the website. I just need to create three functions for adding to, removing from, and editing the database</p>
                            <p>
    The easiest function to create is the update function.</p>
                            <pre><code>//Update a blogpost if the user has permissions
exports.updateBlogpost = functions.https.onCall((data, context)=&gt;{
    //Retrieve user data from database
    return admin.firestore().collection(&quot;users&quot;).doc(context.auth.uid).get()
        .then((doc)=&gt;{
            const docData = doc.data();
            console.log(`User: ${context.auth.uid} Data: ${JSON.stringify(docData)}`);
            //Check if the user is an admin
            if (!docData.admin) {
                return {success: false, message: &quot;Access Denied&quot;};
            }
            const newData = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data));
            delete newData.id;
            //Merge-Update the document in the collections
            return admin.firestore().collection('projectblogposts').doc(data.id)
                .set(newData, {merge: true}).then(()=&gt;{
                    return {success: true};
                });
        });
});</code></pre>
                            <p>Firstly, I get the user's data from the <code>'users'</code> collection. Then I check if the user's has the admin field set to <code>true</code>. If the user is an admin, I will find the document in the blogpost collection that has the same id as the id in the data the user provided and merge the new data with the old data.</p>
                            <p> <i>Note: Collections are like tables in SQL, and an entry/record is called a document.</i></p>
                            <p>
    Now I will pretty much copy the code over to create the removal function.</p>
                            <pre><code>//Delete blogpost
exports.deleteBlogpost = functions.https.onCall((data, context)=&gt;{
    //Retrieve user data from database
    return admin.firestore().collection(&quot;users&quot;).doc(context.auth.uid).get()
        .then((doc)=&gt;{
            const docData = doc.data();
            console.log(`User: ${context.auth.uid} Data: ${JSON.stringify(docData)}`);
            //Check if the user is an admin
            if (!docData.admin) {
                return {success: false, message: &quot;Access Denied&quot;};
            }
            //Delete the document from the collection
            console.log(`Deleting blogpost: ${data.id}`);
            return admin.firestore().collection('projectblogposts').doc(data.id).delete().then((ref)=&gt;{
                    sendEmailToMyself(&quot;Portfolio: Project Deleted&quot;,
                    `Hello Evan,
This is an automated email you setup in cloud functions.

                    return {success: true};
                });
        });
});</code></pre>
                            <p>
    This function is almost exactly the same, except after deleting the element I also send an email to myself to notify me a post has been deleted. I'll explain the email system in the next section.</p>
                            <p>
    Now all that's left is creation, which requires a bit more logic than the other two.</p>

                            <p>In the previous section the code featured a function that sends an email to my personal email. I have this in order to be notified when my functions have run properly.</p>
                            <p>
        I am using the nodemailer module in order to send an email from zoho, which is the current host I use for the emails for my website. </p>
                            <p>
        The nodemailer module was fairly easy to setup, I first had to create what's called a transport that will hold the data for the email address from which the email is sent. </p>
                            <pre><code>//Setup email transport
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'smtp.zoho.com',
    port: '465',
    secure: true,
    auth: {
        user: '[redacted]@evanpartidas.com',
        pass: emailPassword,
    },
});</code></pre>
                            <p>
        Of course I don't list emails on here so that I don't get spammed. The password is stored in a separate file.</p>
                            <p>
        Next, I created a function that will send the emails for me to make the code a bit cleaner. </p>
                            <pre><code>
/**
 * Send an email to myself
 * @param {string} subject The subject of the email
 * @param {string} message The text of the email
 * @return {Promise&lt;SMTPTransport.SentMessageInfo&gt;}
 */
function sendEmailToMyself(subject, message) {
    return transporter.sendMail({
        to: &quot;[redacted]&quot;,
        subject: subject,
        from: '[redacted]@evanpartidas.com',
        text: message,
    }).then((something)=&gt;{
        //Log the email response
        console.log(`Email response: ${something.response}`);
        return something;
    });
}</code></pre>
                            <p>
        I also log the response and return the object in case I wish to use it. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="editprojectspage">

                            <p>Finally, the last step is to create a user interface for editing the project metadata database.</p>
                            <p>All the page needs to do is display the entries in the current database and allow for editing/insertion/deletion.</p>
                            <p>Because react.js is great at quickly creating interactable interfaces, I coded this part using react.</p>
                            <p>
        The code is a bit long and is not very interesting. It is located at <a href="/editprojects.js">http://www.evanpartidas.com/editprojects.js</a> </p>
                            <p>There was one problem where, after adding or removing from the database, the list of items would have a duplicate element in place of the added element, or would often have a phantom element with the deleted entry's data in place of another element whose entry is still in the database.</p>

                            <p><i>Here's an example of a duplicated element in place of an added element.</i></p>
                            <p>I assumed this was because of some feature that react.js has to save computation power by using old data in place of new data.</p>
                            <p>My suspicions were pretty spot on, react.js will simply pass in the new props to a component instead of reconstructing it. Which definitely makes sense, however, since our state data is not updated when this happens it leads to the odd results seen earlier.</p>
                            <p>The fix was very simple, I just hooked into the event that is fired when the props are updated and update the state data as well.</p>
                            <pre><code>//This function is essential, if the props get updated, the state will not. Most likely due to react saving CPU by not reconstructing all the react components.
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if(prevProps.data &amp;&amp; prevProps.data.id !== this.props.data.id){
        this.setState({
            cloudData: this.props.data,
            data: this.props.data,
            filtersString: JSON.stringify(this.props.data.filters)});
    }
}</code></pre>

                            <p>I now have a way to dynamically edit the project metadata. This can help save me a lot of commits that would just be "updating project metadata."</p>
                            <p>I am also very comfortable with Firebase for both backend and frontend development after completing this project.</p>
                            <p>In the future I plan to continue to use Firebase for authentication and for database storage, but I will move to AWS instead of Github in order to allow me to edit pages and more otherwise static data using an online UI as opposed to committing the changes to a Github Repo.</p>
